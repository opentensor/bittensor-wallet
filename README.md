# BittensorWallet - v1.0.0

BittensorWallet is a submodule of the wallet module for Bittensor. This module manages wallet keypairs, keyfiles, etc. for the [Bittensor Python API](https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor).  

The purpose of this repo is to separate the concern of keyfile management from the https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor repo, to decrease the attack surface of Bittensor related to local keys and wallet functionality.
