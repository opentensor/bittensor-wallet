# BittensorWallet - v0.0.2

BittensorWallet is a library for managing wallet keypairs, keyfiles, etc. for the [Bittensor Python API](https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor).  

The purpose of this repo is to separate the concern of keyfile management from the https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor repo, to decrease the attack surface of Bittensor related to local keys and wallet functionality.
